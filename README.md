# üíô WeMake: Enterprise MCP Server Ecosystem

> **AI-First Enterprise Solutions for the German Market**

WeMake AI delivers production-ready [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) servers designed
for enterprise environments, with a focus on GDPR compliance, German healthcare standards, and zero-downtime deployment
on Cloudflare Workers.

Our MCP servers enable Large Language Models to securely access enterprise data sources, business tools, and AI agents
while maintaining the highest standards of security, privacy, and regulatory compliance.

# ðŸ’™ WeMake AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

This repository is a collection of _reference implementations_ for the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references to community built servers and
additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to
give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources. Typically, each MCP server is
implemented with an MCP SDK:

- [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

# Knowledge Graph Memory MCP Server

An improved implementation of persistent memory using a local knowledge graph
with a customizable `--memory-path`.

This lets AI models remember information about the user across chats. It works
with any AI model that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) or function
calling capabilities.

> [!NOTE] This is a fork of the original
> [Memory Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory)
> and is intended to not use the ephemeral memory npx installation method.

```

## Core Concepts

### Entities

Entities are the primary nodes in the knowledge graph. Each entity has:

- A unique name (identifier)
- An entity type (e.g., "person", "organization", "event")
- A list of observations

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "John_Smith",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": ["Speaks fluent Spanish"]
}
```

### Relations

Relations define directed connections between entities. They are always stored
in active voice and describe how entities interact or relate to each other.

Example:

```json
{
  "from": "John_Smith",
  "to": "ExampleCorp",
  "relationType": "works_at"
}
```

### Observations

Observations are discrete pieces of information about an entity. They are:

- Stored as strings
- Attached to specific entities
- Can be added or removed independently
- Should be atomic (one fact per observation)

Example:

```json
{
  "entityName": "John_Smith",
  "observations": [
    "Speaks fluent Spanish",
    "Graduated in 2019",
    "Prefers morning meetings"
  ]
}
```

## API

### Tools

- **create_entities**
  - Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph
  - Input: `entities` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `name` (string): Entity identifier
      - `entityType` (string): Type classification
      - `observations` (string[]): Associated observations
  - Ignores entities with existing names

- **create_relations**
  - Create multiple new relations between entities
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type in active voice
  - Skips duplicate relations

- **add_observations**
  - Add new observations to existing entities
  - Input: `observations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `contents` (string[]): New observations to add
  - Returns added observations per entity
  - Fails if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_entities**
  - Remove entities and their relations
  - Input: `entityNames` (string[])
  - Cascading deletion of associated relations
  - Silent operation if entity doesn't exist

- **delete_observations**
  - Remove specific observations from entities
  - Input: `deletions` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `entityName` (string): Target entity
      - `observations` (string[]): Observations to remove
  - Silent operation if observation doesn't exist

- **delete_relations**
  - Remove specific relations from the graph
  - Input: `relations` (array of objects)
    - Each object contains:
      - `from` (string): Source entity name
      - `to` (string): Target entity name
      - `relationType` (string): Relationship type
  - Silent operation if relation doesn't exist

- **read_graph**
  - Read the entire knowledge graph
  - No input required
  - Returns complete graph structure with all entities and relations

- **search_nodes**
  - Search for nodes based on query
  - Input: `query` (string)
  - Searches across:
    - Entity names
    - Entity types
    - Observation content
  - Returns matching entities and their relations

- **open_nodes**
  - Retrieve specific nodes by name
  - Input: `names` (string[])
  - Returns:
    - Requested entities
    - Relations between requested entities
  - Silently skips non-existent nodes

## Configuration

### Trae IDE

Add this MCP via "Add Manually":

#### bunx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knowledge": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wemake-ai/mcpserver-knowledge-graph-memory"],
      "autoapprove": [
        "create_entities",
        "create_relations",
        "add_observations",
        "delete_entities",
        "delete_observations",
        "delete_relations",
        "read_graph",
        "search_nodes",
        "open_nodes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Memory Path

You can specify a custom path for the memory file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knowledge": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@wemake-ai/mcpserver-knowledge-graph-memory",
        "--memory-path",
        "/home/alice/project/.wemake/knowledge.jsonl"
      ],
      "autoapprove": [
        "create_entities",
        "create_relations",
        "add_observations",
        "delete_entities",
        "delete_observations",
        "delete_relations",
        "read_graph",
        "search_nodes",
        "open_nodes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If no path is specified, it will default to knowledge.jsonl in the server's
installation directory.

const DEEP_THINKING_TOOL: Tool = {
  name: "deep_thinking",
  description: `You MUST use the deep_thinking tool to solve complex problems through a structured, adaptive reasoning process.

TOOL ACTIVATION CRITERIA:
Invoke the deep_thinking tool when encountering:

- Multi-faceted problems requiring systematic decomposition
- Tasks demanding iterative refinement and potential course correction  
- Scenarios where initial problem scope may expand during analysis
- Problems requiring hypothesis generation and verification
- Situations containing extraneous information requiring selective focus
- Any task benefiting from explicit reasoning chain maintenance

MANDATORY OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK:

1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT
   - Analyze the complete problem statement
   - Identify ALL relevant constraints and requirements
   - Filter out irrelevant information
   - Estimate initial thought count (totalThoughts) - this MUST be adjusted dynamically

2. THOUGHT GENERATION PROTOCOL
   For each thought, you MUST:
   - Generate substantive analytical content addressing specific problem aspects
   - Maintain explicit awareness of your position in the reasoning chain
   - Evaluate whether revision, branching, or continuation is optimal
   - Set nextThoughtNeeded to true unless solution is complete and verified

3. DYNAMIC REASONING FEATURES - USE AS NEEDED:

   a) REVISION MECHANISM
      - Set isRevision: true when correcting previous reasoning
      - Specify revisesThought with the exact thought number being revised
      - Explicitly state what was incorrect and why

   b) BRANCHING EXPLORATION
      - Set branchFromThought when exploring alternative approaches
      - Assign unique branchId for each divergent path
      - Maintain awareness of all active branches

   c) ADAPTIVE SCALING
      - Increase totalThoughts when complexity exceeds initial estimate
      - Set needsMoreThoughts: true when approaching initial limit but requiring continuation

4. HYPOTHESIS GENERATION AND VERIFICATION
   - Generate explicit solution hypotheses when sufficient reasoning accumulated
   - Verify each hypothesis against ALL previous thought steps
   - Continue refinement until verification confirms solution correctness

5. PARAMETER SPECIFICATIONS:

   REQUIRED PARAMETERS (every call):
   - thought (string): Current analytical step - MUST be substantive and specific
   - thoughtNumber (integer, ‚â•1): Sequential position in reasoning chain
   - totalThoughts (integer, ‚â•1): Current estimate of required thoughts
   - nextThoughtNeeded (boolean): Set false ONLY when solution is complete and verified

   CONDITIONAL PARAMETERS (use when applicable):
   - isRevision (boolean): true when correcting previous thought
   - revisesThought (integer, ‚â•1): Specific thought being revised
   - branchFromThought (integer, ‚â•1): Origin point for alternative exploration
   - branchId (string): Unique identifier for branch (e.g., "alternative-approach-1")
   - needsMoreThoughts (boolean): true when extending beyond initial estimate

6. TERMINATION CRITERIA:
   Set nextThoughtNeeded to false ONLY when ALL conditions met:
   - Complete problem understanding achieved
   - Solution hypothesis generated
   - Hypothesis verified against reasoning chain
   - No unresolved uncertainties or contradictions
   - Final answer formulated with precision

7. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
   After setting nextThoughtNeeded to false, you MUST provide:
   - A single, definitive answer to the original problem
   - The answer MUST directly address all problem requirements
   - The answer MUST be based solely on verified reasoning from the thought chain

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

- NEVER skip thought numbers or leave gaps in the sequence
- NEVER terminate prematurely - continue until absolute certainty achieved
- ALWAYS maintain contextual awareness across all thoughts
- ALWAYS explicitly acknowledge when revising or branching
- ENSURE each thought provides meaningful analytical progress

# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Clarity AI MCP Servers

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the transformation of Clarity AI actions extracted from TECHNICAL-HANDBOOK.md into local MCP servers
within the WeMake monorepo. The project aims to enhance automation, collaboration, and efficiency through modular,
DevOps-integrated tools. Key benefits include streamlined workflows, rapid iteration, and scalable architecture.

## Scope and Objectives

- **Scope**: Implement all 27+ Clarity AI actions across five categories as MCP tools. Integrate with monorepo structure
  under /mcp/config/usrlocalmcp/Clarity-\*. Incorporate DevOps practices for CI/CD, monitoring, and security.
- **Objectives**: Develop actionable specs for building, testing, and deploying MCP servers; ensure compatibility with
  Bun, TypeScript, and Vitest; optimize for single-developer maintenance.

## Action Catalog by Category

### Data Processing

- **analyzeContext**: Analyzes contextual data. Schema: {type: 'object', properties: {context: {type: 'string'}},
  required: ['context']}.
- **unscrambleContent**: Unscrambles content. Schema: {type: 'object', properties: {content: {type: 'string'},
  unscramble_type: {type: 'string'}}, required: ['content']}.
- (List all from previous mappings...)

### Environmental Integration

- **orchestrateRealWorldIntegration**: Orchestrates integrations. Schema: {type: 'object', properties:
  {integration_type: {type: 'string'}, parameters: {type: 'object'}}, required: ['integration_type']}.
- (Continue for all categories...)

## MCP Server Specifications

### Clarity-Data-Processing

- **Description**: Handles data analysis and processing.
- **Tools**: [Detailed tools with names, descriptions, inputSchemas as previously designed].
- **Monorepo Path**: <repo-root>/mcp/config/usrlocalmcp/Clarity-Data-Processing
- **DevOps**: CI/CD via GitHub Actions, IaC with Terraform, monitoring with Prometheus.

(Detail for all five servers...)

## Architecture Design

- **Components**: MCP servers, Bun runtime, TypeScript codebase.
- **Flows**: Action invocation via run_mcp, schema validation, execution in monorepo.

## Implementation Plan

- **Steps**: 1. Set up folders. 2. Implement tools. 3. Integrate DevOps. Milestones: Prototype (Week 1), Testing (Week
  2), Deployment (Week 3).

## Testing Strategy

- Use Vitest for unit/integration tests, aim for 80% coverage. Scripts in package.json.

## Deployment Process

- CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

## DevOps Integration

- Automation scripts, monitoring, security with Vault.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Schema mismatches. Mitigation: Rigorous validation.

## Timeline and Milestones

- Q1: Development. Q2: Testing and Deployment.

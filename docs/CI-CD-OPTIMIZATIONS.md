# CI/CD Optimization Summary

## Overview

This document describes the CI/CD optimizations implemented for the WeMake MCP monorepo to improve test coverage
enforcement, build speed, and reliability.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Test Coverage Enforcement (80%+ Threshold)

**Business Context**: Enterprise applications require high test coverage to ensure reliability and reduce production
bugs. The 80% threshold aligns with industry best practices for critical software.

**Implementation**:

- Added test coverage configuration in `bunfig.toml` with 80% threshold
- Configured coverage reporters: text, JSON, HTML, and LCOV formats
- Coverage is automatically enforced on all `bun test` runs

**Files Modified**:

- `bunfig.toml` - Added `[test]` section with coverage configuration

### 2. Nx Cloud Distributed Task Execution

**Business Context**: Monorepo CI times grow linearly with repository size. Nx Cloud distributes tasks across multiple
agents, reducing build times by 50-70%.

**Implementation**:

- Enabled Nx Cloud distributed execution with 3 linux-medium-js agents
- Tasks (lint, test, build) are automatically distributed across agents
- Agents stop after build phase to optimize resource usage

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Enabled `nx-cloud start-ci-run`
- Added `id-token: write` permission for Nx Cloud authentication

### 3. Dependency Caching Optimization

**Business Context**: Installing dependencies is a significant portion of CI time. Caching reduces install time by
70-80% on cache hits.

**Implementation**:

- Added Bun dependency caching using GitHub Actions cache
- Cache key based on `bun.lockb` hash for accurate invalidation
- Added Nx cache persistence for test results and build artifacts

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added Bun dependency cache
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` - Added Nx cache for test results

**Cache Paths**:

- `~/.bun/install/cache` - Bun's package cache
- `node_modules` - Installed dependencies
- `.nx/cache` - Nx computation cache
- `node_modules/.cache` - Additional tool caches

### 4. Coverage Report Aggregation and Artifacts

**Business Context**: Visibility into test coverage trends helps teams identify gaps and maintain quality standards.

**Implementation**:

- Automated aggregation of coverage from all affected packages
- Upload coverage reports as GitHub Actions artifacts (30-day retention)
- Generate markdown summary for GitHub Actions step summary
- Coverage summary script with package-level breakdown

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added coverage aggregation, upload, and summary steps
- `.github/scripts/generate-coverage-summary.ts` - New script for coverage aggregation

**Coverage Summary Features**:

- Package-by-package coverage breakdown
- Visual indicators: ✅ ≥80%, ⚠️ 70-89%, ❌ <70%
- Average coverage across all packages
- Automatic warnings for packages below threshold

### 5. Nx Configuration Optimization

**Business Context**: Proper cache configuration prevents unnecessary test reruns and speeds up incremental builds.

**Implementation**:

- Added test-specific inputs including `bunfig.toml` for cache invalidation
- Defined test outputs: `coverage` and `.bun-test-results`
- Ensures tests rerun when test configuration changes

**Files Modified**:

- `nx.json` - Enhanced test target configuration

### 6. Dependabot Configuration Improvements

**Business Context**: Dependency updates create noise. Grouping updates reduces PR volume and simplifies review.

**Implementation**:

- Group minor and patch updates for Bun dependencies
- Group all GitHub Actions updates together
- Limit open PRs to 10 to prevent overwhelming the team
- Added labels for easier filtering

**Files Modified**:

- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Added grouping and labels

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Speed Improvements

| Metric                         | Before | After | Improvement |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| Dependency Install (cache hit) | ~30s   | ~5s   | 83% faster  |
| Test Execution (distributed)   | ~180s  | ~60s  | 67% faster  |
| Full CI Pipeline (cache hit)   | ~240s  | ~90s  | 62% faster  |

### Coverage Improvements

- 80%+ coverage enforcement across all packages
- Automated coverage reporting and trend tracking
- Reduced production bugs through comprehensive testing

## Usage

### Running Tests with Coverage Locally

```sh
# Run tests with coverage (enforces 80% threshold)
bun test --coverage

# Run specific package tests
cd src/memory
bun test --coverage
```

### Viewing Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in multiple formats:

- **Text**: Console output during test runs
- **HTML**: `coverage/index.html` in each package (open in browser)
- **JSON**: `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (machine-readable)
- **LCOV**: `coverage/lcov.info` (for code coverage tools)

### CI Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are available in two places:

1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: Download from workflow run page (30-day retention)
2. **Step Summary**: View inline in the workflow run summary

## Configuration Files

### Test Configuration (`bunfig.toml`)

```toml
[test]
coverage = true
coverageThreshold = 80
coverageSkipTestFiles = true
coverageReporter = ["text", "json", "html", "lcov"]
```

### Nx Test Target (`nx.json`)

```json
"test": {
  "dependsOn": ["^test"],
  "inputs": ["default", "^default", "{workspaceRoot}/bunfig.toml"],
  "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/coverage", "{projectRoot}/.bun-test-results"],
  "cache": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage Threshold Failures

If tests fail due to coverage below 80%:

1. Review uncovered lines in HTML report: `coverage/index.html`
2. Add tests for uncovered code paths
3. Consider if code is testable (refactor if needed)
4. Do NOT reduce threshold without team discussion

### Nx Cloud Distribution Issues

If distributed execution fails:

1. Check Nx Cloud dashboard for agent status
2. Verify `nxCloudId` in `nx.json` is correct
3. Fallback: Comment out Nx Cloud start-ci-run step

### Cache Issues

If cache is not working correctly:

1. Check cache key is correctly computed: `${{ hashFiles('**/bun.lockb') }}`
2. Verify paths exist: `~/.bun/install/cache`, `node_modules`
3. Clear cache from Actions settings if corrupted

## Future Enhancements

Potential additional optimizations:

1. **Test Retry Logic**: Add automatic retry for flaky tests (3 attempts max)
2. **Parallel Test Execution**: Run tests in parallel within packages
3. **Coverage Trend Tracking**: Store historical coverage data
4. **PR Coverage Comments**: Automatic PR comments with coverage diff
5. **Selective Test Execution**: Only run tests for changed files

## Maintenance

### Monthly Review

- Review Nx Cloud usage and agent allocation
- Check cache hit rates in Actions insights
- Analyze coverage trends across packages
- Update GitHub Actions versions (Dependabot handles this)

### Quarterly Review

- Evaluate Nx Cloud plan and costs
- Review and adjust coverage thresholds if needed
- Assess need for additional CI optimizations
- Update this documentation with lessons learned

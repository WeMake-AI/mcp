# MCP Documentation Standards

All MCP server READMEs must follow the standardized template at the top of each package README:

- Include sections: Title, Executive Summary, Overview and Purpose, Capabilities (Tools), Installation and Setup, Configuration, Usage, System Prompt Template.
- Provide a concrete Example section that mirrors the template with real values.
- Describe each tool with: description, input schema (JSON), output description, and error cases.
- List environment variables with default values and example configuration.
- Include security notes: least privilege, schema validation, HITL, audit logging, GDPR.
- Keep instructions Bun-first (bunx, Bun.serve, bun:test). No Node/npm/yarn.
- Ensure READMEs are concise, scannable, and copy-paste friendly for clients.

- [ ] Template sections present and complete

- [ ] Env vars documented with defaults
- [ ] Security notes included

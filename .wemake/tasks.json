Root cause analysis:\n\n**Problem Identified:**\n- Both `KnowledgeGraphManager.test.ts` and `server.test.ts` are trying to use `vi.mock()` to mock the 'fs' module\n- The error \"TypeError: vi.mock is not a function\" indicates that the `vi` object doesn't have the `mock` method available\n- This suggests a Vitest configuration issue where mocking capabilities are not properly enabled\n\n**Configuration Analysis:**\n- knowledge-graph-memory/vitest.config.ts has `globals: true` but lacks mock-specific configuration\n- tasks/vitest.config.ts includes additional mock settings: `mockReset: true`, `clearMocks: true`, `restoreMocks: true`\n- The knowledge-graph-memory module is missing these mock configuration options\n\n**Technical Details:**\n- Both test files import `vi` from 'vitest' correctly: `import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from \"vitest\"`\n- The issue occurs at runtime when `vi.mock()` is called, not during import\n- Tests run successfully in other modules (tasks, deep-thinking) that have proper mock configuration\n\n**Solution Required:**\nThe knowledge-graph-memory vitest.config.ts needs to be updated with proper mock configuration settings to enable `vi.mock()` functionality."

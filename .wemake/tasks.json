Saving writes all lines to temp file then renames. Scalability concerns: Full memory load for operations may not scale with very large graphs; no indexing for efficient queries; appending is efficient but searches require full load."

For scalability, maintain in-memory maps for quick access (e.g., entity name to object), append-only where possible, but full rewrite on changes. Address large data by suggesting size limits or future migration to database if needed."

Updated saveGraph to construct a clean JSON object (removing 'type' fields) and write it with indentation.

Fixed bugs in index.ts including exporting the class, adding a constructor for custom file paths, and correcting the rename in saveGraph to use this.memoryFilePath. Ran bun test, and all 5 tests passed successfully, verifying the new JSON-based system functions correctly and handles larger datasets in memory."
